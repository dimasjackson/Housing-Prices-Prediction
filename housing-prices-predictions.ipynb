First of all, the data will be imported from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course) and preprocessed using different techniques. We will select the best preprocess technique between Ordinal Encoder, One-hot Encoder or simply dropping out categorical data, by comparison of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the predictions generated by each approach. Next, we will create a pipeline to implement the best preprocess more quickly, which will allow us to test different machine learning models. Then, we will compare the MAE of different Random Forest and Gradient Boost models, varying the number of estimators and the learning rate. The model that results in the smallest MAE in validation data will be used to generate predictions using the test data, which will be submited to the competition.\n","\n","![Ames Housing dataset image](https://i.imgur.com/lTJVG4e.png)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"898f81cf","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01265,"end_time":"2022-12-10T22:43:54.627988","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-10T22:43:54.615338","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Importing and Spliting the Data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"131ef492","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01134,"end_time":"2022-12-10T22:43:54.650925","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-10T22:43:54.639585","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["The next code cell will split the training data in training and validation set.
