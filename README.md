# Housing-Prices-Prediction
This is a project to predict the sale price of a house given data about location, lot size,  road access, etc. We compared different encodes techniques, and tested different machine learning models using Random Forest regressor. Also, we improve the predictions using the Extreme Gradient Boost algorithm, varying the number of estimations and changing the learning rate. The model that results in the smallest MAE in validation data was submitted to the Kaggle Housing Prices competition, ranking on top 5% of the leaderboard.
